    "#Rest - Uses HTTPS - communicated using put,get,post,delete. It is simple,scalable,flexibility, heavy weighted\n",
    "#SOAP - Uses XML messaging protocol, WSDL language(Web Services Description Language), Supports HTTPS,SMTP,TCP/IP protocol. \n",
    "        #Complex in terms of implementation . It is stateless, layered and can also cache it. It is light weighted.\n",

    "#RESTful services are based on following services:\n",
    "    #Client-Server architecture - client and server are seperated allowing them to evolve independently \n",
    "    #Stateless - Each request sent to the server contains all the information needed to complete the request. The server does not maintin any client context between requests\n",
    "    #Cacheable - responses from the cached to improve the performance \n",
    "    #Uniform interface - RESTful services  use a uniform interface, HTTP verbs\n",
    "    #Layered system - RESTful services can be improves by introducing multiple layers\n"
